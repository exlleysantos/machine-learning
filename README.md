# 🧠 Machine Learning Studies

This repository is dedicated to my studies in **Machine Learning**, covering everything from theoretical foundations to practical applications using Python.  
The goal is to document progress, build experimental projects, and develop a solid foundation in machine learning.

---

## 📘 Purpose

This repository aims to consolidate knowledge in:
- Data manipulation and analysis
- Preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model creation, training, and evaluation
- Optimization, validation, and deployment of models
- Experiment documentation and version control
